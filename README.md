The Tennis Major Tournament Match Statistics dataset
is a collection of eight files containing detailed information on tennis matches played in major tournaments from 2000 to 2017. These files include match statistics for both men and women at the four major tennis tournaments of the year, such as player names, results, first serve percentages, aces, unforced errors, and more. The dataset is suitable for various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. The data was donated in 2014 by Shruti Jauhari, Aniket Morankar, and Ernest Fokoue from the Rochester Institute of Technology.
